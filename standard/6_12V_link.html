implemented as a DC bus with a nominal voltage of 12V. The ODG 12V Link includes a communications capability
based on the LIN Bus using a third signal wire besides the two power poles. Communications is required to be
provided by all conforming power sources but optional for loads such as appliances.</p> <p>A bus connection means that multiple devices
are electrically connected via wires and will observe roughly the same electrical potential
though the actual observed potential may differ between devices due to resistive drops on the wires.</p> <p>The actual wiring may be in a variety of topological configurations such as:</p> <ul><li>point to point - two ports connect with a single link</li> <li>star where all drops are connected at a single point</li> <li>linear configuration with multiple taps branching from a distribution</li> <li>tree-like configuration with multiple branch points fanning out into a web of connections.</li></ul> <p>All conforming ODG 12V link devices must implement a sleep mode that reduces its current
consumption when the supplied voltage drops below a defined threshold to avoid
draining battery sources to unhealthy levels. In sleep mode, the communications
and management circuits are expected to operate normally.
At a still lower voltage device are expected to go into a deeper form
of sleep referred to here as disconnect mode that consumes negligible
power to protect the power. When normal voltages are restored, devices shall
resume normal operation without user intervention.</p> <p>The ODG 12V Link is defined for interoperability with most existing 12V appliances and power sources.
Most existing 12V appliances can be attached to an ODG conforming power source and will operate as expected.
In this section, such devices will be referred to as legacy devices.
Physical connectivity can be implemented with a passive adapter that matches the legacy device's connector
to the connector specified here.
Similarly, ODG 12V Link conforming appliances and other loads will operate as expected
except for communications when attached to existing 12V
power sources such as a 12V battery or automobile auxiliary power connector using a
passive adapter.</p> <p>Devices conforming to the ODG 12V Link allow consumers to attach appliances to power sources and be
confident that their appliance will operate as expected but also have additional benefits for consumers and resellers.
The ODG 12V Link contains features such as polarity
protection that make it goof resistant when attached using ad-hoc wiring.
When implemented by appliances, the optional communications capability enables many functions such as
power allocation, remote control, management and PAYG.
Multiple conforming sources can be attached to a single 12V bus with default or
configuration-specific power allocation.</p> <p>Low voltage DC connectivity has long been challenged by conflicting definitions
for the commonly used coaxial connectors, often referred to as barrel connectors.
The ODG 12V Link uses such a connector. It attempts to mitigate the risk of
conflicting definitions by selecting a connector that is less commonly
used except for the specific case of laptop AC power adapters and
this standard contains provisions that specifically permit such adapters
to be attached to conforming appliances. Such appliances will operate
as expected when attached to an AC power adapter so long as the adapter
can supply sufficient current and will fail gracefully when the adapter
cannot supply enough current.</p> <p>The ODG 12V Link also provides compatibility to the ISO 16750 standard for automotive
electric devices in that devices conforming to the ISO standard will operate
when connected to an ODG power source and ODG conforming appliances will
operate when connected to an ISO power source. Most of the ISO test requirements
also apply to ODG 12V Link conforming devices but some extreme requirements
specific to the automotive environment are not required of ODG 12V Link devices.</p> <p>The ODG 12V Link supports communications between devices attached to the bus
through a variation of the LIN Bus used for low-speed communications in automobiles.
This communications interface is optional for load devices but required for
power sources except for AC adapters. These communications are used to
manage a bus with more than one power source,
implement priority allocation of power to loads, and for the remote management
of appliances or other loads that choose to implement it including PAYG.
The communications system includes the concept of a functional bus manager
but this function is not restricted to a particular physical device
as with a typical LIN Bus and can potentially be shifted between devices
as needed when devices are attached or removed from the bus.
While capable of general purpose messages, this communication system is intended
primarily for bus management and should not be considered a substitute
for high speed communications through WiFi or other technologies.
Communications details are provided in the following sections.</p> <h2 id="port-types"><a href="#port-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> Port Types</h2> <p>As defined the the architecture section, this standard defines a port as
an electrical interface to a device with specified characteristics.
The ODG 12V link defines four types of ports:</p> <ul><li>Load ports only consume power such as the port on an appliance</li> <li>Source ports only supply power</li> <li>Bidirectional ports can consume or supply power like a battery</li> <li>AC adapter ports are a special kind of source port with reduced functionality</li></ul> <p>In the simplest configuration, a load port is attached to a source port with a cable.
More complex combinations are possible such as a source that powers multiple loads
or an arbitrary collection of load, source and bidirectional ports attached to
a common bus. AC adapter ports can only attach to a single load port or
a bidirectional port with the optional capability to support AC adapters.</p> <h2 id="connectors-plugs-and-sockets"><a href="#connectors-plugs-and-sockets" class="header-anchor">#</a> Connectors - Plugs and Sockets</h2> <p>The ODG 12V Link is based on a standard coaxial (barrel) connector currently used on many laptop AC power adapters:</p> <ul><li>7.5 mm outside diameter</li> <li>5.0 mm inside diameter</li> <li>3 pole</li></ul> <p>This connector is wired with the negative pole on the outer surface, the positive pole on the inner surface.
The center pin is used for data communications.</p> <p>Source ports and bidirectional ports always use a female socket.
Load ports are recommended to also use a female socket assuming a detachable male plug-to-plug cable
but they may optionally use a hardwired cable with a male plug.
Use of the female socket on load ports is recommended so they can be powered by existing
AC power adapters that come with hardwired male plugs on a cable.
AC adapter ports are assumed to always have a male plug on a cable.</p> <h2 id="electrical-requirements"><a href="#electrical-requirements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Electrical Requirements</h2> <p>This section defines the electrical requirements of the ODG 12V Link which can vary by type of port.

as measured on the source connector. The source shall supply at least V<sub>min_s</sub> when sourcing its maximum rated power.
Load ports shall operate normally when receiving power whose voltage is in the range of V<sub>min_l</sub> to V<sub>max_l</sub>
as measured on the load connector or plug.
AC adapter ports are permitted to source power with the voltage in the range V<sub>min_s</sub> to V<sub>max_a</sub> as measured at their plug.</p> <p>Loads are expected to operate normally over a wider range than source ports normally supply
to let them operate with 19.5 V-style AC power adapters and, at the low end, to accommodate an IR voltage
drop between the source and the load.
The normal source upper voltage limit is constrained to a lower voltage than V<sub>max_a</sub> to prevent
damage to legacy devices attached to an ODG bus.</p> <p>All load ports and bidirectional ports receiving power are expected reduce their current draw
and go into sleep mode when the received voltage drops below V<sub>min_l</sub>.
This standard makes a distinction between the communications circuits of a device and circuits related to its primary function.
The communications circuits are expected to operate at a lower voltage than the primary circuits
so they can report an under-voltage condition even when the primary function cannot be performed.
If implemented on a device, communications circuits are expected to operate normally when the received
voltage is in the range V<sub>min_c</sub> to V<sub>max_l</sub>. When receiving less than V<sub>min_c</sub>,
devices shall enter disconnect mode and draw negligible current.</p> <p>Note that devices are expected to delay entering the sleep or disconnect states to
prevent the interruption of normal operation during temporary voltage dropouts (see below).
The delay before entering a sleep state must be at least t<sub>dropout</sub> but no
longer than t<sub>sleep</sub>.</p> <p>All ports except AC adapter ports shall implement sustained over-voltage protection to V<sub>ovp</sub>.
This protection applies to both negative and positive poles as well as the communications signal.
During the over-voltage, the device is not required to maintain normal operation (Functional Status 1),
but may enter a less functional state (Functional Status 3). When the voltage returns to normal
limits the device must resume normal operation (Functional Status 1) with no intervention by the user.
Details of the required conformance test are given in Appendix C.
that include stress pulses of various voltage peaks, durations and repetitions.</p> <p>Source ports and bidirectional ports operating as sources shall limit the voltage overshoot to less than V<sub>ovs</sub>
when a load is disconnected. Test conditions are given in Appendix C and require the disconnect
of the maximum rated load for the port.</p> <p>Load ports and bidirectional ports receiving power shall limit conducted emissions
to voltages less than V<sub>cond</sub>. This is normally only relevant to inductive loads.
Test conditions are given in Appendix C.</p> <h3 id="current"><a href="#current" class="header-anchor">#</a> Current</h3> <p>The maximum current supplied by a source or bidirectional port, or consumed by a load
through a connector shall be I<sub>max</sub>.
A source or bidirectional port is not required to provide any minimum level of current.</p> <p>A device in sleep mode shall reduce its current consumption to I<sub>sleep</sub> or less.
A device in disconnect mode shall reduce its current consumption to I<sub>disconnect</sub> or less.</p> <p>Devices requiring current in excess of I<sub>max</sub>
or sources providing more current may exceed these current limits
if they provide alternate means of connection such as screw terminals. Such devices
shall conform to all voltage requirements and shall describe their wiring requirements
in their documentation. Sources shall provide over-current protection suitable to protect
the wiring and connections as described in their documentation. They shall also
implement the sleep mode and disconnect mode current limits.</p> <p>All devices supplying power through a source or bidirectional port shall implement communications over those ports.
Devices offering non-standard connections such as screw terminals shall include terminals
for communications that is compatible with the connector-based communications signaling.</p> <p>More than one power source can be attached to a bus. To allocate current fairly between sources, all sources
shall implemented droop control. [Details TBD.]</p> <p>[Should we permit non-droop control sources on a bus? A device could identify itself as either
being droop controlled or not. A not droop control source would not permit any other sources on the bus.]</p> <p>Communications signaling between sources is used to limit the
the maximum current flow through the bus wiring.
All source devices shall have the capability of limiting their maximum current output
to a level designated in a configuration message from the current bus manager.
By default, the maximum current from all sources shall be limited to I<sub>max</sub>.
The maximum current from all sources in an installation shall be configurable to
level higher than I<sub>max</sub> through appropriate management software
if a trained installer can ensure that the wiring can support the higher current.
It is the responsibility of the current bus manager (see TBD) to ensure that all power sources
are appropriately configured to the designed bus current limit.</p> <p>The maximum current of an AC adapter port is not defined by this standard.
It is the responsibility of the load to ensure that it does not draw enough
current to damage its own connector or wiring.</p> <h3 id="over-current-protection"><a href="#over-current-protection" class="header-anchor">#</a> Over-current Protection</h3> <p>A port sourcing power shall include over-current protection to prevent damage to the device in the event
of a fault that shorts the positive pole to the negative pole for an unlimited time period.
The over-current protection from a source or bidirectional port shall automatically
reset so the device resumes normal operation when the fault is resolved.
An over-current condition shall be reported using communications as described in section TBD.</p> <p>[ Must resume normal operations in TBD seconds. How is resume initiated? ]</p> <p>The over-current condition shall be reported by an LED located near the connector
as described in <em>Port Status Indicator</em>.</p> <p>If a load device supports communications, it shall report the maximum normal operating current
of the device at the minimum supply voltage and shall also report the limit and duration of any
temporary current surges the device may experience such as those related to motor starts, using
the protocols described in <em>Communications</em>.</p> <p>A load port is recommended but not required to provide over-current protection from faults internal
to the device that would result in current draws in excess of its rated maximum. Over-current
protection for a load may be implemented with a fuse. A replaceable fuse is recommended
but not required. If the device supports communications, it is recommended that the communications
be implemented such that communications remain operating even when the primary over-current protection
has disabled the device so the device may report the fault condition.</p> <p>A fault that shorts the communications pin to either pole will disable communications
but not have any permanent effect on the device such that communications will resume
normal operation when the fault is resolved.</p> <p>[ Should we permit temporary current overloads in excess of 8 A? ]</p> <p>[ Motor start overloads ?? ]</p> <p>[ Capacitor overloads ?? ]</p> <h3 id="grid-overload-and-fault-isolation"><a href="#grid-overload-and-fault-isolation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Grid Overload and Fault Isolation</h3> <p>Many circumstances can cause the overall power demand from loads to exceed the power available from sources.
In the simple case with a source supplying power to non-communicating loads wired to a common bus
this can manifest as an over-current condition analogous to blowing a fuse on a normal AC grid.
The source must use its normal over-current protection and disconnect current flow.</p> <p>A managed grid like ODG has more options. If its sources have multiple ports that can controlled
independently, it may be able via current monitoring to isolate the overload to one port
and disconnect that port while leaving the others functioning. If the load on each
port is below I<sub>max</sub> but the aggregate exceeds the current capacity of the source,
it may choose to shut down a subset of its ports on a priority basis.</p> <p>Communicating loads give the source or sources more options. Among the parameters that
a communicating load is required to supply is its normal power demand. The grid can selectively
prioritize loads using administrative configuration.</p> <p>[More TBD]</p> <h3 id="reverse-polarity-protection"><a href="#reverse-polarity-protection" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reverse Polarity Protection</h3> <p>All ports shall implement reverse polarity protection so that the device is not damaged
when connected to a voltage source of V<sub>reverse</sub> for an indefinite period.
When connected with reverse polarity, the device is not expected to function (Functional Status 3)
but must resume normal operation (Functional Status 1) when correct polarity is re-applied
with no intervention by the user required.</p> <p>If a port supports communications, recommended that the communications logic
be powered by a full-bridge rectifier so that it will continue to operate
with the power poles reversed and can report the fault using the methods
described in section TBD.</p> <p>It is recommended [ Required?? ] that all devices implement an LED that will
illuminate red with the power poles are reversed.</p> <h3 id="drop-out-protection"><a href="#drop-out-protection" class="header-anchor">#</a> Drop-out Protection</h3> <p>Various conditions as when new loads are attached
may cause the bus to temporarily drop to a lower than normal voltage,
a condition known as voltage dropout.
Load devices are expected continue to operate normally (Functional Status 1)
during voltage dropouts. During the test to verify the device,
voltage is lowered to V<sub>dropout</sub> for a period t<sub>dropout</sub>
and then return to normal.
Details of the conformance test are given in Appendix C.</p> <h3 id="noise-immunity"><a href="#noise-immunity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Noise Immunity</h3> <p>Load devices are expected normally (Functional Status 1) when an AC voltage of V<sub>AC</sub> is superimposed
on their normal supply voltage. This AC voltage can be any frequency between f<sub>AC_min</sub>
and f<sub>AC_max</sub>. Details of the conformance test are given in Appendix C.</p> <h3 id="slow-rise-and-fall-of-supply-voltage"><a href="#slow-rise-and-fall-of-supply-voltage" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slow Rise and Fall of Supply Voltage</h3> <p>Load devices are expected to transition through levels of function when the voltage they
receive increase or decrease slowly as might be expected from a battery charging or discharging.
From 0 volts to V<sub>min_c</sub>, the device is expected to be in the disconnect state
drawing negligible current. It may have no apparent function. From V<sub>min_c</sub> to V<sub>min_l</sub>
it should be in the sleep state such that communications is operating normally (Functional Status 1)
but the devices primary function may not be available (Functional Status 3). It must enter
normal operation (Functional Status 1) when the voltage enters the normal operating range of V<sub>min_l</sub>
to V<sub>max_l</sub>. The reverse sequence must occur when the supply voltage begins to decrease.
As part of its drop-out protection the device is may delay changing to a higher functional
for a period no more than V<sub>dropout</sub>. While the voltage is dropping, the device
must enter the sleep or disconnect state within t<sub>sleep</sub>.
Details of the conformance test are given in Appendix C.</p> <p>There is another test requiring that the device maintain the proper operational state when
the supply voltage fluctuates to progressively lower level and then returns to normal
in steps with a period of t<sub>sleep</sub> or greater.<br>

For example, the communications signal may be connected when either the positive or negative power
circuit is disconnected. The device shall be undamaged but potentially non-functional (Functional Status 3)
under all combinations of attached wiring.</p> <p>A load device that implements communications but does receive the normal communications recessive signal
shall assume that it is connected to a non-standard power source. It should perform all its normal

relative to the source reference. Devices are typically implemented to use the negative pole as a signal ground
reference and therefor differences between the negative poles on each device may result in differing
signal ground references in each device. If these devices are connected together with another cable
besides the 12V Link power cable such as a USB communications cable that connects the grounds,
unexpected current may flow through the ground connections. This condition is commonly referred
to as a ground loop. The ground loop will result in noise that disrupts the communications
signals and in extreme cases may result in damage to the equipment.</p> <p>[Need illustration]</p> <p>To avoid this problem, when any two devices powered by a signal 12V Link are connected
with another cable, at least one of them must use a galvanic isolator on its power cable.
This is a device that electrically isolates the power poles across the device so that
the down stream side is electrically floating relative to their common reference.
This isolation breaks the ground loop and solves the problem.</p> <p>[Need illustration]</p> <h3 id="cold-start"><a href="#cold-start" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cold Start</h3> <p>Grids based on the 12V Link may experience a temporary overload when power is first applied to
the 12V bus to charge input capacitors and initiate other start-up functions such as
refrigeration motor starts. Devices without communications but with the ability to control
their input current through a FET switch are recommended to delay their power-on with a randomly
selected delay up to TBD seconds to minimize the chance of a startup overload.</p> <p>Loads with communications and the ability to control their input current shall attempt
to establish communications with the current bus manager before admitting start-up currents.
If communications can be established with the bus manager, they shall request power from
the bus manager and delay their start until a power grant message has been received from
the bus manager. The bus manager shall stage power initiation to reduce the chance of
an overload. More details of the protocol are contained in the <em>Communications</em> section.</p> <h3 id="port-labeling"><a href="#port-labeling" class="header-anchor">#</a> Port Labeling</h3> <p>[ Use ODG label with separate icon for load, source or bidirectional.

The different link types have different forms of communications that best fit the intended applications
of that link so the ODG approach is to support different forms of physical and low layer protocols
with semantically consistent upper layers so that the different protocol stacks and be easily
bridged when necessary between different link types.</p> <p>Communications for the 12V Link is based on the LIN Bus at the physical layer, a unique link layer
that is optimized for the target applications, a subset of CoAP in the middle layers and an application layer
homologous to a subset of IEEE 2030.5 (SEP 2) but again, optimized for ODG. Its key features include:</p> <ul><li>Implementation on very small microcontrollers</li> <li>Negligible power consumption for an inactive bus or inactive nodes</li> <li>Automatic address assignment and configuration</li> <li>Peer to peer communications</li> <li>Automatic data rate adaptation of 1 - 20 kbps</li> <li>Operation to 40 m without twisted pairs</li></ul> <p>The following description of the ODG 12V Link communications approach is based on the traditional
7-layer OSI communications model. Some of the layers are different from existing standards so
the entire stack here is referred to as ODGTalk, just to give it a unique label.</p> <h3 id="physical-layer"><a href="#physical-layer" class="header-anchor">#</a> Physical Layer</h3> <p>The physical layer is based on the LIN bus. Implementations can use existing LIN bus transceivers,
though the selected transceiver must support the full voltage range of V<sub>min_c</sub> to V<sub>max_l</sub>
for normal operation and V<sub>reverse</sub> to V<sub>ovp</sub> over-voltage and reverse-voltage protection.
For the following, the voltage observed at a device as the difference between the positive and negative poles
is referred to as V<sub>bus</sub>.
The two LIN signal thresholds are:</p> <ul><li>80% to 100% of V<sub>bus</sub> recessive signal (serial high)</li> <li>0% to 20% of V<sub>bus</sub> dominant (serial low)</li></ul> <p>One node, designated the bus manager, pulls the bus high through a 1K ohm resistor and FET switch to make the
default state be the recessive state. Transceivers pull the bus down to the dominant signal for signaling.</p> <p>When used with the 12V Link, all sources shall be capable of assuming the bus manager role and activating
the associated pull-up. When multiple sources are connected to a bus, a link layer arbitration protocol
selects which of the bus manager candidates assumes the role. Another link layer protocol permits
fail safe operation to shift the bus manager role if the original bus manager disconnects for whatever reason.</p> <p>Signal timing is based on the current data rate for the bus which can vary between 1 kbps and 20 kbps.
The bus manager selects the bus rate. Other nodes use a synchronization mechanism to automatically
match the current received bus rate when transmitting. It is possible that a node can fail to
synchronize due to the physical limitations of a particular installation. In that case, it can
request a slower data rate by forcing an extended dominant (break) condition on the bus.
The current bus manager must observe this request and initiate transmission at a slower data rate.
This process repeats at slower and slower data rates until all nodes synchronize. If synchronization
cannot be achieved at 1 kbps, communications is declared non-operational and nodes revert to
their non-communications mode.</p> <h3 id="link-layer"><a href="#link-layer" class="header-anchor">#</a> Link Layer</h3> <p>The ODGTalk link layer includes protocols to assign select the bus manager, select the data rate,
assign local addresses and transmit transmit data frames. The data frame format has been chosen to take
advantage of power-saving features built into many micro-controllers to minimize the power
consumption of individual nodes and for the ODGTalk network as a whole.</p> <p>Whenever a node joins the network by being plugged into a 12V Link bus or by receiving power
from another source it performs the following steps in sequence.</p> <h4 id="_1-master-arbitration"><a href="#_1-master-arbitration" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. Master Arbitration</h4> <p>When a node capable of being a master joins the network, it must decide if there is an
existing master, in which case it should join as a normal node, or if there is no master,
it should assume the master role. Upon initialization such a node first observes the
bus. It observes network traffic, there must already be a master so it joins as a normal node.
If there is no traffic observed, it waits for a random delay of TBD and transmits a wakeup
probe, which is a break of TBD seconds. If a master is already active, the master will
respond to the wakeup probe and the candidate joins as a normal node. If there is no response
after TBD seconds, it retries the wakeup probe. If there is not response after TBD retries,
the candidate activates its master pull-up and assumes the master role.</p> <p>[ Note that transceivers have a weak built-in pull-up so observing a recessive state is not
sufficient to ensure that a master already exists. ]</p> <h4 id="_2-data-rate-selection"><a href="#_2-data-rate-selection" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Data Rate Selection</h4> <p>ODGTalk permits dynamic adjustment of the data rate to deal with changing physical conditions on the bus.
Each frame transmitted on the bus includes a synchronization field similar to LIN that enables the receiver
to automatically set its receive data rate using the timing in the synchronization field.
When a device initializes, it observes the bus for activity and if found, it sets it data rate using the observed traffic.
If there is no traffic, it sends a wakeup probe, a break sequence, like that used in the master arbitration.
This will trigger a wakeup response from the master and the new node can then set its date rate.</p> <p>Changing physical conditions on the bus can make data transmission unreliable and require the bus to slow down.
Any node observing excessive data errors can request  the bus to slow down. There are two methods to do this.
If the bus is marginal, any node can send a data errors alert using normal transmission methods to the master.
If this does not result in a slow-down sequence, a node can initiate a special slow down alert
which is an extended break of TBD seconds. The master observes this event and initiates a slow down sequence.
A slow down sequence is a broadcast message send to all nodes telling them to reinitialize their data rate.</p> <p>[Note that the master hardware must be to determine the length of a break using counters or other mechanisms. - Details TBD.]</p> <h4 id="_3-address-registration"><a href="#_3-address-registration" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Address Registration</h4> <p>Each node on the bus has a logical bus address that is assigned dynamically.
Once assigned, it responds only to messages to that address or broadcast transmissions which are sent to all nodes.<br>
If the device hardware supports a hardware address filter, it can set its assigned address in that filter
so that it only wakes on messages to that address.</p> <p>Part the address registration sequence includes a flag that indicates if the device is using a hardware filter.
If it is, the device will not receive a broadcast message. In that case, the master sends each such node a broadcast
prime message instructing the node to temporarily disable the address filter until after the broadcast.
After it receives the broadcast, it can resume using the filter.</p> <p>Address registration occurs during node initialization, after the data rate has been established.
Address 0 is reserved for the master. Slave nodes can use any of the 15 remaining address.
A slave begins by choosing a random address between 1 and 15.
To register an address, the registering node sends a registration request to the master using the address it selected.
The master sends a registration response to that address indicating whether the registration was successful.<br>
If another node has already registered that address, both nodes will receive the response.
The node that previously registered that address can ignore the response.
The failure response includes an alternative address that the device can adopt.
It can also indicate that no more addresses are available in the unlikely case that 15 slaves have already registered.</p> <p>The address registration message include the 64-bit IP6 address of the node. This can be queried
by a proxy node to establish the IP6 address of the target node.</p> <h4 id="_4-data-transmission"><a href="#_4-data-transmission" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Data Transmission</h4> <p>Normal data transmission in ODGTalk uses a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CMSA/CA) mechanism.
In this case, a &quot;carrier&quot; is just activity on the bus. A node can send a message to any other node at any time.
To send a message, it first observes the bus by enabling data reception.
If there is no activity on the bus, the node can send its message immediately.
If there is activity, it just delays a random time of TBD seconds and checks again.
It is still possible that two nodes can start transmitting at the same time causing a collision.
All messages must assume the possibility of transmission errors and include a retry mechanism.
Collisions are resolved using normal retransmission.</p> <p>[TBD: receive your own message and watch for data corruption indicating a collision. Abort and retry.]</p> <p>[TBD: wait for end of transmission by a timeout. Then delay a slot time based on the address.]</p> <h4 id="frame-format"><a href="#frame-format" class="header-anchor">#</a> Frame Format</h4> <p>At the bit level, ODGTalk uses a normal UART format:</p> <ul><li>9-bits / character (9th bit ignored except for address flag)</li> <li>1 stop bit</li> <li>no parity</li></ul> <p>The basic frame structure is similar to LIN:</p> <ul><li>break (wake up all transceivers)</li> <li>sync (0x55 to establish the data rate through auto baud rate recognition if not already established)</li> <li>destination address and frame type (includes address flag)</li> <li>source address</li> <li>frame length</li> <li>message content (0 - 127 bytes)</li> <li>CRC (2-byte CCITT-16)</li></ul> <p>This frame structure is chosen to enable hardware optimizations built in to many micro-controllers.
Some devices include auto baud rate detection registers. Most devices include address detection
using the 9th bit called multiprocessor communications mode. Some devices also include hardware
support for the calculation of the CRC.</p> <p>With no bus activity, all transceivers are in sleep mode and all micro-controllers can be in sleep mode.
Once transmission starts, all transceivers wake up. Micro-controllers with address-recognition hardware
can stay asleep except for their address compare logic.</p> <h3 id="network-layer"><a href="#network-layer" class="header-anchor">#</a> Network Layer</h3> <p>In normal operation, there is no network layer in ODGTalk. Nodes are incapable of directly communicating
with nodes outside their own bus, and similarly, there is no direct way for an external network
to directly access an ODGTalk node. This is for both simplicity and security. The physical span
of an ODGTalk network is limited to the physical span of one 12V Link.</p> <p>However, any node that has access to another network such as the Internet, can act as a proxy for
nodes in ODGTalk. As part of joining the ODGTalk network, a node is required to register its IP6 address with the
the bus manager. This creates a mapping between an IP6 address and the local address in an ODGTalk network.
Any node on the ODTTalk network can query this mapping and thus proxy messages between the networks.</p> <p>In addition, the link layer supports multiple frame types. One of the supported frame types can
use 6loWPAN-style header compression and packet reassembly to create full IP6 frames.
This capability is optional for 12V Link nodes.</p> <h3 id="transport-layer"><a href="#transport-layer" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transport Layer</h3> <p>The core transport layer is based on a subset of CoAP (rfc7252) with exponential back-off.
