# Contributing Guideline

We welcome every sort of contribution, from error reports to improvements of the document or entirely new ideas or chapters.

## GitHub workflow

With GitHub as the backend, the development of this specification applies well-established collaboration workflows as used in software development.

If you are not yet familiar with the git-based collaboration, the easiest way is probably to use the GitHub web interface:

1. Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch in your account named after what you want to change.
3. Modify or add files and commit the changes.
4. Submit a pull request via the GitHub web interface and wait for the response of other contributors or reviewers.

### Important remarks:

- Better make several small [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention) than
  a single big one
- Use meaningful commit messages. Tell *what* was changed and not that *something* was changed. "Grid stability:
  Voltage graph added" is much better than "Updates". You can also reference an issue with its numer (e.g. #123) in the commit message
