# Welcome to the open DC grid working group

This document specifies core requirements and suggestions for implementation of a DC grid to interconnect multiple energy sources and sinks. It can be considered a grid code for a low-power separated extra-low voltage (SELV) DC grid.

The specification is manufacturer-agnostic. Only the interfaces at grid level will be defined to allow seamless integration of devices made by different manufacturers.
